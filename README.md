Another Totally Awesome Bull Shit Coin
Totally awsome because it is designed to create wealth through "forced" value from the undervalue of XLM
We call it a "Bull Shit" coin because no coin is backed by any real value, only it's popularity as a "store of value".
The Stellar ecosystem has many great possibilities and we aim to explore them all!
This coin may become the native token for the platform so that hodling it to provide liquidity will mean INCOME!
It was minted at the time when XLM was about $.07 and given a value of "14 xlm". Approximately the value of $1USD.
No one is obligated to trade their coin for what they paid for it and can ask for it's "value" which could drive the price of xlm... depending on our popularity! Isn't that what drives Bitcoin?
